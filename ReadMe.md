Name: Ophelia Swen

Project Working Title: Snackster



Description:

Snackster is a website that provides an online forum space and a photo log of favorite snacks and teas.



Use Case:

Users are actors who enjoy sharing snacks and teas with each other and are eager to try different varieties of them. Website will include a forum space for people to start discussion threads and groups over their favorite products. User can log in to their account and can create posts in the forum or to the journal section of their account. They can also upload photos. There will be a search bar to search for suggestions and ideas for snacks shared amongst the community. User can add tasting notes to the product. Communication between members can occur via messaging tool. Bookmarking posts to save as reference is an option and there will be a central image board that users can view.

Additional Information

I aim to at least show implementation of crud functionality for the features listed in MVP and build a nice looking image board. I am not too certain about the messaging system and how to build a forum feature yet, hoping perhaps a combination of research, books, video tutorials will lead me somewhere.
